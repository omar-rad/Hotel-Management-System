# Hotel-Management-System

anyone willing to book a room, can view the available booking options according to their search criteria on the website. Once they find any, they can pay and confirm the booking after they register on the website.
Any guest registered account will be able to modify or cancel their confirmed bookings.
The HMS will take care of such confirmation records along with its guestsâ€™ information.
In case of managing the hotel rooms, the hotel stuff will be able to use the system for the purpose of such managements after they create their corresponding administrative accounts.
The HST will no longer face unorganized emails, as the website will have the functionality to organize them.
